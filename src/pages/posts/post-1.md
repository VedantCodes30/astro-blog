Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning astro! here, i will share my learning journey as i build a new website.


## What i've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new astro project and setup.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
